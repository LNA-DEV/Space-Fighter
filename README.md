# Space-Fighter
This is a school project. <br>
All game assets are made by myself. <br>

### Goal
It's a game where you can conrol a rocket.<br> 
The goal is that none of the Aliens hit the rocket **or** the bottom of the screen / earth.<br>
You can achieve that by killing the Aliens with the Laser-Gun of your Rocket.<br>

#### Attention: You can't shoot and move at the same time!
The difficulty must come from somewhere^^
