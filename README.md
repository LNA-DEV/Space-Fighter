This is a school project. <br>
All game assets are made by myself. <br>

### Goal üöÄ
It's a game where you can conrol a rocket.<br> 
The goal is that none of the Aliens hit the rocket **or** the bottom of the screen / earth.<br>
You can achieve that by killing the Aliens with the Laser-Gun of your rocket.<br>

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: You can't shoot and move at the same time!
The difficulty must come from somewhere^^ <br>
Also you can't shoot more than three bullets at a time.<br>
If your bullets don't hit one of the aliens your score decreases by one.
